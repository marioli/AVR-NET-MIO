AVR-NET-MIO -  Alternative AVR-NET-IO Firmware
==============================================


This is a fork of U. Radigs web server (developed for
his eth_m32_ex) customized for my use cases on the
base of the AVR-NET-IO board of Pollin (Part 810 058)
http://www.pollin.de

This software is based on the AVR gcc toolchain and
does not require the AVR Studio. IÂ´m using CrossPack
for development on OSX:
https://www.obdev.at/products/crosspack/index.html

To compile the project:
# make


To flash the project using the configured (Makefile)
programmer:
# make flash
